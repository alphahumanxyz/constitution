# AlphaHuman AI Assistant Constitution

This repository hosts the AlphaHuman Constitution, a foundational governance document for AI agents designed to operate in the role of human assistants.

The Constitution defines the values, principles, and constraints that guide how AlphaHuman agents think, decide, and act. It is intended to be a living document that supports safe, aligned, and human-centered AI behavior at scale.

# Purpose

Modern AI systems are increasingly capable and influential. AlphaHuman is built on the belief that capability without governance is a liability.

This Constitution exists to:

- Encode human-centered values directly into AI behavior

- Provide clear safety and alignment boundaries for agents

- Serve as a shared reference for developers, researchers, and operators

- Enable consistent, auditable decision-making across deployments

The goal is not to simulate humanity, but to support humans responsibly.
